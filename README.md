**N.B.: Since I'm not a certified developer, both Windows and macOS will warn
you the first time you try to open the application.**

- On **Windows** you can select _More Info_ and _Run Anyway_ on the warning
  message.
- **macOS** will tell you the app is broken (or something along those lines). To
  use the tool, you have to disable _Gatekeeper_:

  1. Open the _Terminal_ app
  2. Type `xattr -cr "/path/to/ROM Hack Manager.app"` and hit _Enter_
  3. Open the app again

  You can find a better explanation on

Do this only if you trust me :)

## Features

With _ROM Hack Manager_ you can:

- **Manage hacks:** The tool will list SNES ROM hacks for selected games.
- **Download hacks:** Download, unzip, and patch hacks automatically. You can
  search _Super Mario World_ and _Yoshi Island_ hacks on SMWCentral's catalogue
  directly from within the tool.

You can check the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.txt) for an exhaustive list of changes
for every version.

## Guide

Instructions on how to use the tool and its features.

### Configure a game

Before you can download a hack, you need to configure a game. A game consists of
the following:

- _Name_: Name of the game, it can be anything (it's the name that appears in
  the tabs on top).
- _Folder_: Folder containing the hacks for the game. The tool will download
  hacks for the game inside this folder.
- _Original copy_: Original copy of the game, as a ROM. Patches downloaded with
  the tool will be applied to this file (without modifying it).

| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                                           Configure a game                                           |

Configuring a game doesn't create any directory, it only operates existing ones.
You can remove a game from the tool through the tabs on top

| <img src="./docs/images/remove_game.gif" alt="Remove a game" width="400px" max-width="100%" style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 10px;" /> |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                                                                    Remove a game                                                                     |

Removing a game this way won't remove any folder, it will just tell the tool not
to list the game.

You can change the game's name, folder, and original copy from the game tab
itself (under the _Settings_ section, collapsed by default).

### Download a hack

To download (and patch) a hack, you have to specify:

- _Name_: A name of your choosing (usually the name of the hack). This will be
  the name of the folder created by the tool inside the game folder.
- _Download URL_: URL for downloading the zip file. For example, you can find
  this URL on SMWCentral.

| <img src="./docs/images/download_hack.gif" alt="Download a hack manually" width="400px" max-width="100%" style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 10px;" /> |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                                                                     Download a hack manually                                                                      |

You can also look for a game present on SMWCentral directly from within the tool

| <img src="./docs/images/search_hack.gif" alt="Look for a hack in SMWCentral's catalogue" width="400px" max-width="100%" /> |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                                         Look for a hack in SMWCentral's catalogue                                          |

You can look for _Super Mario World_ and _Yoshi Island_ hacks.

The tool will download the zip file from the given URL, extract it inside a
folder of the chosen name (`<game_folder>/<hack_name>`), and it will patch the
first `.bps` file it finds.

If the URL doesn't download a zip, or if the zip doesn't contain a `.bps` file,
the operation will fail.

After you download a hack, you'll have to wait a few seconds for it to appear in
the list underneath, while the tool is syncing with the operating system.

### Manage hacks

Once you configured a game (_i.e._, selected a folder containing that game's
hacks), the tool will list hacks present in that folder. A hack is a folder
containing a `.sfc` file.

The tool provides the following operations on hacks

- **Play:** The tool opens the `.sfc` file of the hack with its default
  application (it should be an emulator). You can specify the default app on you
  operating system. If the hack has more than one `.sfc` file, the tool will
  play the one that you see in the table (you cannot control which one).
- **Open folder:** Open the folder containing the hack.
- **Delete:** Delete the hack. This deletes the folder of the hack and all its
  contents.

### Settings

The tab with the gear icon allows to modify global settings. Their names should
be pretty self-explanatory.

By default, the tool will open SFC file with the default app specified in the
operating system. It's possible to specify a custom emulator path and arguments
via settings. This is especially useful when using RetroArch, which requires
opening files with the `-L` flag.

You can also specify a custom cookie that will be used for search and downloads,
to bypass CAPTCHAs.
